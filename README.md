CS50 2017 Week 1:

:sparkles: 1) Hello.c;
  http://docs.cs50.net/problems/hello/hello.html
  
  *Cath's Murmurs: 
  (^ This assignment's requirements brought me here (on Github! :octocat: :metal: )... ;D :+1: )
  This part was more about setting up Github than making hello.c work.
  And here I am! :D :tada:  
  
:sparkles: 2) Water.c; 
  http://docs.cs50.net/problems/water/water.html
  
  *Cath's Murmurs:
  Tackling this assignment took me a while as I familiarized myself with more C syntax, expressions, and concepts;
  my navigation of the pull requests on Github also took me a while to get it straightened out.
  I wanted to show my progression at the point where I was stuck (with the conditional statement), 
  to the part where I figured it out with the if-else, 
  then arriving at the understanding of when my phrasing for retry worked: 
  printf("Try again with a positive integer larger than 0.\n");
  
  I'm happy to say that though my husby HawxChen did make some commits in this repository, 
  I insisted on doing it my way (thinking it through, struggling, and finding myself enjoying the process with appreciation in the end.)
  
 :sparkles: 3) Mario.c; 
  http://docs.cs50.net/problems/mario/less/mario.html
  
  *Cath's Murmurs: 
  This was a super tough exercise that helped me pick up some good habits. I started making line by line comments to help me stay on track of understanding what I was doing, which was crucial in getting through this exercise. I think I'm becoming more familiar on how to utilize variables and defining them as I use them--now familiar with the command line controls too. I picked up important concepts such as how to conceptualize this exercise (grid system--r0,d0), using nested for loops (and grasping how they work). I definitely used Hawx's help and explanation for this exercise, since my math/logic memories and skills have been dormant for quite a while and I wasn't really grasping the hints in the walkthrough videos.
  
But hey, I bet these feelings are normal for such a newbie like me. ;D Keep at it! - :rocket: 

 :sparkles: 4) Greedy.c;
