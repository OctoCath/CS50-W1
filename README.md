CS50 2017 Week 1:

:sparkles: Hello.c;
  http://docs.cs50.net/problems/hello/hello.html
  
  *Cath's Murmurs: 
  (^ This assignment's requirements brought me here (on Github! :octocat: :metal: )... ;D :+1: )
  This part was more about setting up Github than making hello.c work.
  And here I am! :D :tada:  
  
:sparkles: Water.c;

  *Cath's Murmurs:
  Tackling this assignment took me a while as I familiarized myself with more C syntax, expressions, and concepts;
  my navigation of the pull requests on Github also took me a while to get it straightened out.
  I wanted to show my progression at the point where I was stuck (with the conditional statement), 
  to the part where I figured it out with the if-else, 
  then arriving at the understanding of when my phrasing for retry worked: 
  printf("Try again with a positive integer larger than 0.\n");
  
  I'm happy to say that though my husby HawxChen did make some commits in this repository, 
  I insisted on doing it my way (thinking it through, struggling, and finding myself enjoying the process with appreciation in the end.)
  
  Stay tuned as I tackle the next one......! :rocket:
